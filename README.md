# Chatbot Web Scraper
This application serves as a web scraping tool designed to extract product data from websites that align with a user's specified keyword search.

Enables communication between a bot and a user using Dialogflow and Webhooks.

During the communication, Dialogflow detects the user's intentions and accordingly performs API operations from a server located in Replit and these requests make use of Scraping and Regex.

Each request represents real-time data that has been retrieved using Scraping.
